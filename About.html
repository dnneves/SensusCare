				<h1>What is Sensus Care?</h1>

					<p style="text-align: justify;”><strong>Sensus Care</strong> is a new concept for remote patient monitoring, aiming to support the treatment process of a broad range of mood disorders. <strong>Sensus Care</strong> was created by <strong>Sensus Technologies</strong>, which consists of a team of 6 young tech entrepreneurs from all over Europe. The team was created through the EU-XCEL program funded by the European Union. EU-XCEL is a European Venture Program and focused on creating and supporting European tech entrepreneurs to build information and communication technology (ICT) startups.</p>

                            <h1>The Problem</h1>

					<p style="text-align: justify;”>More and more people are suffering from mental disorders affecting their everyday life. Within this range of people most are suffering from mood disorders covering conditions ranging from severe depression and anxiety, to bipolar and schizoaffective disorder. These mental disorders can vary from passing to periodic to even chronic states, but nevertheless it is possible to help the affected people by the use of therapy and medication. Research has indicated that only half of those afflicted with mood disorders are receiving treatment. This is crucial as untreated mental disorders can cause lack of energy, anti-social behaviour, loss of work ability and sleep interference. In severe cases untreated mood disorders can lead to suicide - and these statistics are growing in a terrifying manner! Another outcome of untreated mood disorders is the need for post hospitalisation treatment following a relapse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;”>We believe that the key to help people suffering from mood disorders and keep them healthy is to prevent relapses. This is done through counselling and medication alterations. The frequency with which patients meet and consult with psychiatrists is often not enough to prevent this. Furthermore, the data psychiatrists manage to extract during interviews with patients are often incomplete or not representative of the patient’s entire week/month/however long it’s been since last meeting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;”>There is a growing need for tools and ways to embrace monitored patient treatment in order to help a broader range of patients when receiving outpatient treatment. It is known that patients can benefit from tracking their everyday mood and thereby becoming aware of their mental state along with relating this to other things affecting their lives. Tracking of sleep, medicine and awareness of the things that brings satisfaction is also beneficial when treating mood disorders.</p>


				<h1>The Solution</h1>

					

<p style="text-align: justify;”><strong>Sensus Care</strong> is a remote patient monitoring platform for patients with mood disorders. We feel that psychiatrists and patients alike can benefit by more frequent ‘automated’ communication. We aim to achieve this via delivery of daily questionnaires to patients (through smartphones or the web) which aim to assess the patients’ mood. Our software attempts to determine whether the patient is stable and if not, deliver more questions to better understand the phase the patient is in.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;”>What we believe is the real innovation of our platform, is its capability to automatically recognise when a patient might need help and alert their doctor. Furthermore, it can make it easier to monitor several important variables, such as a patient’s progress, treatment compliance, medication and treatment history, and history of episodes and relapses.</p>
